## Overview

This work took place during June 2024 in the SPICE Summer Data Science Institute. Students began the institute by exploring cropland mapping techniques with [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn-examples/tree/main/crop-type-classification) and running google colab notebooks made freely available by [NASA Harvest](https://github.com/nasaharvest). Excited by the [work NASA Harvest was doing in Hawaii](https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/nasa-ai-artificial-intelligence-farm-mapping-hawaii-wildfires/700757/), the team reached out to Dr. Hannah Kerner & Ivan Zvonkov. They generously shared project ideas, google earth engine scripts, and cropland labels that were annotated by the NASA Harvest team based on high-resolution satellite data. SPICE students, Ashley and Roma, learned from these scripts and adapted them to generate cropland accuracy scores and train a random forest to improve cropland accuracy for Maui County. We are extremely grateful for the guidance from Ivan Zvonkov. 

**Please Note**: The scripts and videos in this repository represent students learning about cropland mapping and machine learning in this context for the first time. The research is exploratory and *primarily intended for the educational experience* of the SPICE students. In the presentation videos, when the students reference "ground truth data points collected by UH Maui", this was actually cropland labels that were annotated by the NASA Harvest team based on high-resolution satellite data. This is very important for context but does not neccesarily change the validity of the accuracy scores / improved cropland map for Maui County. If interested in this topic, please stay up to date with the [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/) team and their amazing work!
