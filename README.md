## Overview

This work took place during June 2024 in the SPICE Summer Data Science Institute. Students began the institute by exploring cropland mapping techniques with [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn-examples/tree/main/crop-type-classification) and running google colab notebooks made freely available by [NASA Harvest](https://github.com/nasaharvest). Excited by the [work NASA Harvest was doing in Hawaii](https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/nasa-ai-artificial-intelligence-farm-mapping-hawaii-wildfires/700757/), the team reached out to Dr. Hannah Kerner & Ivan Zvonknov. They generously shared project ideas, google earth engine scripts, and ground truth data for Maui Cropland collected by students from University of Hawaii Maui Campus. SPICE students, Ashley and Roma, learned from these scripts and adapted them to generate cropland accuracy scores and train a random forest to improve cropland accuracy for Maui County. We are extremely grateful for the guidance from Ivan Zvonknov. **Please Note**: The scripts and videos in this repository represent students learning about cropland mapping and machine learning in this context for the first time. The research is exploratory and *primarily intended for the educational experience* of the SPICE students. If interested, please stay up to date with the [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/) team and their amazing work!
